This Repository is all about the popular Object Oriented programming language Lab concepts and their variations Which can be helpful to Competitive Programming and Coding Interviews.

Structured programming languages are high-level programming languages that use a specific programming structure known as "structured programming." Structured programming is a programming paradigm that focuses on breaking down a program into smaller and more manageable modules or blocks of code called procedures or functions. These procedures or functions are then composed, organized, and executed sequentially to achieve a specific task.

Structured programming languages typically include control structures such as loops (for, while, and do-while), conditional statements (if-else and switch-case), and subroutines (procedures and functions). These control structures help organise and control the flow of execution in a program.

Examples of structured programming languages include:

C: C is a widely used structured programming language that provides a rich set of control structures and supports modular programming through functions.

Pascal: Pascal is a structured programming language designed for teaching programming concepts. It emphasizes code readability and clarity.

Ada: Ada is a structured programming language known for its strong typing and modular design. It is used in safety-critical systems and large-scale software development.

Structured programming languages have clear advantages over unstructured programming languages, such as improving code readability, maintainability, and debugging. Using structured programming techniques helps write more organized, efficient, and reliable code.
