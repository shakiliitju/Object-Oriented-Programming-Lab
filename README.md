This Repository is all about the popular Object Oriented programming language Lab concepts and their variations Which can be helpful to Competitive Programming and Coding Interviews.

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes the code around objects, which are instances of classes. It is a way of designing and constructing computer programs by combining and encapsulating data attributes and the functions or methods that operate on that data.

Some famous examples of object-oriented programming languages are:

Java: One of the most widely used OOP languages, Java is platform-independent and extensively used for building enterprise-level applications.

C++: Derived from the C programming language, C++ allows Object-Oriented programming and procedural programming. It is frequently used for system programming, game development, and large-scale applications.

Python: Python is a versatile and beginner-friendly programming language. It supports OOP and procedural programming approaches and is widely used in various domains, including web development, data science, and automation.

C#: Developed by Microsoft, C# is primarily used for developing Windows applications and is often used with the .NET framework. It is similar to Java in terms of syntax and structure.

Ruby: Ruby is known for its simplicity and readability. It features a clean syntax and is often used for web development and scripting tasks. Ruby on Rails, a popular web framework, is built using Ruby.

These are just a few examples, and many other languages support object-oriented programming.
